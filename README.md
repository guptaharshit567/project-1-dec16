This is my first HTML contest project of Acciojob.
In this project I need to create beagle dog blog with three section in it.
Three sections are one for the top most div, the second for the image and the third for the trivia.
Accordingly I created three section:
First section belong to div tag in div tag I created a heading and paragraph tag.
Second section I have import a image of beagle dog and give a anchor tag and in anchor tag I give a more beagle images link.
And in last section I provided some basic information about beagle dog.
